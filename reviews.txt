The best customer service. They try their best to find the right car for you. Even with no so good credit. They let you know what you can afford. They don’t treat you like you are just another sale for them.

This dealership is like non other! They are so welcoming and kind. They don’t just sell you a car, they help find the best fit for you and make sure you’re happy. Also they actually explain things to you my credit, interest rate, etc. I learned a lot of things that will help me going forward. I recommend them to everyone! Kristina was my salesperson she is awesome! Everyone was.

I was very impressed with the people in the service department, Mariela and Patrick. While I was waiting I visited with Taylor, he was very helpful in our discussion of electric vehicles.  I had brought in my Volt for maintenance work. My local dealer would not attempt to work on my car due to staffing issues. The dealership in Tyler was unable to correct my problem after having the car half a day. You can imagine my anxiety at that point.  The staff at McKaig was friendly, helpful and reassuring. I left the car there since it was Friday afternoon. Monday morning I got a call from Mariela and my car was repaired.  The repair cost was very reasonable. I am thankful to everyone that I visited with.

He was super patient with all mi kids and being with us until 10pm! We are from Henderson, TX and definitely was worth the drive! I appreciate the help we got from Dennis, McCloskey, and  Prickett.

This is my second time coming in and my husband’s fourth time and between any other dealership we’ve been to this is the best one yet. McKaig works with you good credit or bad and will help you based off of income. After coming here so many times between both me and my husband we have recommended it to friends and family and I know they have never been disappointed either. They keep working with you until the expectations you have for a vehicle is met and they are very honest people. We will definitely be coming here again in the future.

Dec.3rd we decided to take a look at McKaigs certified used cars.  Thinking that was where our credit would allow us to shop. Adrian comes out, greets us and asks the basic questions and made a suggestion to start with seeing where we at credit wise.  So... long story short, we drove off with a brand new, 2020 Trax! Thank you Adrian for your work and Brandon (finance mgr) ! We will recommend McKaigs and Adrian!
